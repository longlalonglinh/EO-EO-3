You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 1-13, which are based on Reading Passage 1 below.

The Life and Discoveries of Marie Curie
Marie Curie is recognized as one of the most distinguished scientists in human history. Born Maria Sklodowska in Warsaw in 1867, she overcame financial hardship and gender prejudice to pursue scientific research in Paris. Together with her husband Pierre Curie, she conducted groundbreaking investigations into radioactivity, eventually isolating the elements polonium and radium.

Her discoveries transformed modern physics and medical therapy. In 1903, she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics alongside Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel, becoming the first woman to receive the accolade. Following Pierre's tragic death in 1906, she succeeded him as Professor of General Physics at the Sorbonne, a milestone for female academia in Europe.

During the First World War, Curie devoted herself to the development of mobile radiological units—informally termed 'petites Curies'—which provided essential diagnostic imaging for wounded soldiers on the frontline. Despite experiencing chronic illness caused by prolonged exposure to ionizing radiation, she continued directing the Radium Institute until her death in 1934.
